Core Template Studio is a .NET Standard 2.0 project that handles all of the template synchronization and code generation (composition, generation + postaction execution) for **[WindowsTemplateStudio](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio)**. The project has two parts: a .NET Standard core and its corresponding Cli that exposes the core.

# Documentation

- [Getting started with the codebase](./docs/getting-started-developers.md).

## Features

- _Synchronizes Templates_: The core has the ability to synchronize with templates, either in debug as a templates folder or in release as a .mstx file. It also builds and refreshes the template cache.
- _Provides information about available templates_: Upon synchronization, the core will provide information on the available project type, framework, page and feature templates.
- _Generate using Templates_: Using the available templates, the core does the composition, generation and postaction execution to create a C# or VB Project.
- _Telemetry_: Performs the majority of telemetry for Windows Template Studio including user selections and generation time.

## Limitations

- Currently does not support Package download and verification from the CDN.
